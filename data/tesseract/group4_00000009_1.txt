Ja nary 10, 1993
Dunn; the years 1980 and 91, and 1991792, under the leadershlp of Tom
Ev.n5, the 053 Commlttee of cm was raiorganlzed, raienerglzed, and became
reognlzed by government agencles as a force for 1ndustry representatlon
an cooperatlve effort. mm thls as a foundatlon we declded to look at the
taks for the year 1992793. He declded that, 1n1tlally, we should raievaluate
th current OSHA admlnlstratlon's attltudE. establlsh cooperatlve, nondupllcatlve efforts mm other 1nter71ndustry groups, establlsh strong Communica*
tl-ns mm other CMA commlttees whose work overlapped and 1nfluenced ours, and
co solldate and/or ellmlnate task groups where feaslble.
Th- attltude of the current OSHA admlnlstratlon was succlnctly made clear
to s by a communlcatlon whlch we recelved from Mark (Iowan, the thehineputy
As Stan: Secretary for OSHA. He 531d, "...After years of statlng that 1ndustry
15 1Ven the opportunlty 15 well equipped to address workplace problems, 1ndustry
no , 1n the OSHA area has an opportunlty whlch may never agaln be repeated. The
op-rtunlty exlsts for corporate Amerlca to double and redouble thelr efforts
1n ms Eleld so as to prove 1: can be done wlthout undue government 1nterference.
The chance to demonstrate concluslvely that companles slncerely care about thelr
wor force 15 avaliable. Should thls opportunlty be mlssed, or worse, should
so oratlons through a daiemphasls of safety and health programs give credence
to he allegatlon that the only concern 1n the boardroom 15 proflt, the old OSHA
of ays past will rlse from the grave mm a Vengeance. Now 15 not the tune for
co oratlons to let down thelr guard nor to relax measures whlch have resulted 1n
gal 5 1n the safety and health area."
He elleve that thls gives us a clear 1nd1catlon that the current OSHA
adm nlstratlon Hill contlnue 1n the vem that they have been and that they are
ope for cooperatlve efforts from 1ndustry groups.
He .re redoubllng our efforts to establlsh closer and more efflclent cooper?
tlo Hlth a number of 1ndustry groups. Since numbers of our health and safety
peole serve on task forces Hlth dlverse organlzatlons, we're attemptlng m determlne
who should have the lead role 1n respondlng m 1nd1v1dual OSHA regulatlons 1n an
effurt to minimize the tune, travel and effort requlred of the members of your
so any on these Varlous commlttees. The organlzatlon deemed most approprlate to
preare the prlmary response does so; the other organlzatlons then adapt the response
to helr needs.
He .re 1n the process of ellmlnatlng some task groups and consolldatlng others
and will reduce the number of task groups from 12 m a or 7 1n an effort to stream?
lln' the work of the 053 comklttee and agaln reduce the tune and travel requlred
by ask group members. However, major efforts will contlnue 1n the area of
