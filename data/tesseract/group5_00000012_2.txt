pendlng occupaclonal dlsease notlflcatlon and preventlon leglslatlon 1ntroduced by

that our analysls of these proposals was 5:111 under way. Ha 1nd1cated that both

REPORT 017
ursmmmmu COMMITTEE
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Two prlmary lssues hava surfaced durlng 1995 relatlve to the
dlstrlbutlon of chemlcals that demand a great deal of attentlon by the
Dlstrlbutlon Commlttee. These are chemlcal transportatlon rlsk
management and nonitarlff trade barrlers affectlng the 1nternatlonal
dlstrlbutlon of chemlcals.
1: has become readlly apparent that the chemlcal manufacturlng
eoonunlty must take a more proactlve role 1n identifying and
compensatlng for the many Varlables that 1nfluence the safe
transportatlon of chemlcals. State and local offlclals,
envlronmentallsts. and congresslonal overslght commlttees are among the
many groups that have expressed concern over the potentlal rlsks
assoclated mm chemlcal transportatlon. The Dlstrlbutlon Commlttee
has Jolned forces mm representatlves from the rallroad and trucklng
1ndustr1es to assess the rlsks of movlng dlfferent types of chemlcals.
Durlng tha upcomlng year rlsk management models will be developed that
1nd1v1dual chemlcal companles can use to work Hlth thelr carrlers 1n
identifying the safest posslble means of transportlng thelr products.
The past year has also brought on a great deal of actlvlty 1n the
1nternatlonal regulatory arena whlch has had a Significant 1mpact on
the dlstrlbutlon of chemlcals. The Distrlbutlon Commlttee has been
1nstrumental 1n tha development of marlne pollutlon requlrements that
guard agalnst the dumplng of chemlcal wastes at sea. Fortunately,
because of the Dlstrlbutlon Commlttee's efforts the 1nternatlonal
requlrements dld not go so far as m curtall 1nternatlonal chemlcal
transportatlon, or make 1: so expenslve for v.5. shlppers that they
would be put at a competitive dlsadvantage mm forelgn chemlcal
companles.
am also played a major role 1n gettlng v. 5. government offlclals
to 1ntervene 1n the efforts of forelgn governments to reserve cargo to
thelr natlons flag Vessels, thus reduclng competltlon and creatlng a
serlous luvpedlment m the safe transportatlon of chemlcals.
The Natlonal Chemlcal Response and Informatlon Center (NCRIC) has
gone beyond the 1ndustry's expectatlons 1n fulfllllng the needs of
emergency responders and the publlc for chemlcal related 1nfomatlon.
cammmc, whlch celebrated 1:5 flfteenth annlversary, has seen a
Significant growth 1n actlvltles over 1935. Calls rose from 34,000
inquiries 1n 1995 to 41,000 1n 1936, a 231 1ncrease. cammm also
1ntroduced the Hazard Infomatlon Transmlsslon System whlch enables
emergency responders to access hard copy chemlcal 1nformatlon Via a
computer llnk. The CHEMNET program, the 1ndustry's flrst all
encompasslng mutual 31:: network, has contlnued to grow 1n slze and
unportance over the past year.
1: was recognlzed by Secretary of
Transportatlon Ellzabeth Dole durlng the 1995 Spllls Conference as a
major 1ndustry initiative to 55515: emergency responders 1n effectlvely
handllng chemlcal transportatlon accldents.
The Name Landlng lerary has also been tremendously successful.
Over 123,000 emergency responders have had the opportunlty m Vlew the
Videos. The chemlcal 1ndustry has recelved countless praise for thls
major effort to traln emergency responders on the proper technlques for
handllng chemlcal emergencles.
The Chemlcal Referral Center responded to over 11,000 inquiries
from the publlc for noniemergency health and safety 1nformatlon about
chemlcals. An 1ndex of approxlmately 110,000 products has been
developed to 35515: the Chemlcal Referral Center 1n qulckly identifying
the approprlate companles to refer callers to. Th1: servlce 1:
expected to contlnue to 1ncrease 1n 1mportance over the comlng year as
states and local communltles unplement the rlghtitoiknow provlslons of
the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorlzatlon Act.
mule a great deal of the Dlstrlbutlon Commlttee's energles were
dlrected at unprovlng the safe transportatlon of chemlcals durlng 1935,
the Commlttee contlnued to promote competltlon and costieffectlve
measures for the dlstrlbutlon of chemlcals. The Commlttee was
successful 1n gettlng the Interstate Commerce Commlsslon m overrule
the efforts of a major rallfoad to flag out of 1:: common carrler
responslbllltles to move certaln chemlcals. The Commlttee also played
a key role 1n helplng to shape practlcal rules for rallroad cost
recovery practlces. CMA also 1ntervened 1n 3 case before the ma 1n an
effort to establlsh a favorable precedent for competitive access
remedles for shlppers captlve m a smgle rallroad.
The reauthorlzatlon of the Hazardous Materlals Transportatlon Act
dld not occur durlng 1995 but 1: 1: expected to recelve conslderable
attentlon 1n 1937. The Dlstrlbutlon Commlttee took advantage of thls
time to promote the CMA posltlon adopted at last January's Board
meetlng. CMA Hill contlnue to take a lead role 1n the development of
reasonable leglslatlon governlng the transportatlon of chemlcals.
