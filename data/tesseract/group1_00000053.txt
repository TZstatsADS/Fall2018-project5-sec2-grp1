of merlca, was on the charter roster of the Air Quallty Commlttee
whe 1: was organlzed 1n 1949, and was an outstandlng contrlbutor
:9 ts program 1n the early years. Upon adoptlon of the "General
Prl clples Appllcable to the Structure and Dperatlons of Commlttees"
1n 953, on his own 1n1tlatlve he 1nqu1red whether the requlrement
of 'merrbericompany fullitlme employee" for commlttee membershlp
wou d affect his status. General Hull, then MCA presldent, rul d
tha thls praiexlstlng menlbershlp could contlnue undlsturbed.
In 954, Alcoa nomlnated Donald (:1 WinsDn, a member of Mr.
Se ans' legal mm, as successor to Mr. Seamans. The record of
B05 d approval 1nd1cates only that Mr. Wlnson represents Alcoa,

The Alr Quallty Commlttee 15 eager for Mr. Wlnson to con*

tlo 1n 1ndustrlal air pollutlon 15 comparatlvely rare, and ms
lea ershlp at thls juncture 15 especlally valuable. He has been,
and 15 personally 1nterested 1n contlnulng to be, an actlve coni
trl utor m the Commlttee's needs. He can be partlcularly helpful
1n he organlzatlon and development of the recently authorlzed
J01 t Subcommlttee on Alr and Water Pollutlon Leglslatlon and

Ace rdlngly, prlmarlly as a "grandfather" case and as such
not otherwlse settlng a precedent, and secondarlly 1n recognltlon
of ontlnulng need by the Commlttee for the servlces he 15 pecui

and Board reconflmatlon annually.
